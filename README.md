# Super Smash Bros Forum - GROUP 10
The Super Smash Bros Ultimate has garnered massive attention from the Nintendo fans since the gameâ€™s release date in December of 2018. With the growing population of Nintendo Switch users, the SSBU (Super Smash Bros Ultimate) fanbase has increased indefinitely. This web application is created for the SSBU gaming community which allows users to interact with one another and share their personal techniques, ideas, and tips to other gamers. 

## Prerequisites
To set up the local web application, download and install the following modules: 

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass)

## Installing
To run the server, open up the command prompt and navigate through the folder where the files are contained. To create the node modules, use the command 

            npm install --save

js file app_data.js using the command

            node add_data.js
This will create the database and populate it with a few users, posts and announcements

Next, run the js file app.js to start the servers using the command

            node app.js
Lastly, on your browser (the members use Google Chrome), enter the url

            localhost:3000

## Running the tests
Once the server is running, it will be available at localhost:3000. This will then bring you to the login page which allows you to login or register as a new user.
